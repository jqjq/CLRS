# Summation formulas and properties

Given a sequence \\(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\\) of numbers, where \\(n\\) is a
nonnegative integer, we can write the finite sum \\(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n\\) as
\\[
  \sum^n_{k=1}a_k.
\\]
If \\(n=0\\), the value of the summation is defined to be \\(0\\). The value of
a finite series is always well defined, and we can add its terms in any order.

Given an infinite sequence \\(a_1,a_2,\dots\\) of numbers, we can write the
infinite sum \\(a_1+a_2+\cdots\\) as
\\[
  \sum^\infty_{k=1}a_k,
\\]
which we interpret to mean
\\[
  \lim_{n\to\infty}\sum^n_{k=1}a_k.
\\]
If the limit does not exist, the series _**diverges**_; otherwise, it
_**converges**_. The terms of a convergent series cannot always be added in any
order. We can, however, rearrange the terms of an _**absolutely convergent
series**_, that is, a series \\(\sum^\infty_{k=1}a_k\\) for which the series
\\(\sum^\infty_{k=1}|a_k|\\) also converges.
