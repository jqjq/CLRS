Getting Started

This chapter will familiarize you with the framework we shall use throughout
the book to think about the design and analysis of algorithms. It is
self-contained, but it does include several references to material that we
introduce in :ref:`Chapters 3 <ch3>` and :ref:`4 <ch4>`. (It also contains
several summations, which :ref:`Appendix A <ch36>` shows how to solve.)

We begin by examining the insertion sort algorithm to solve the sorting problem
introduced in :ref:`Chapters 1 <ch1>`. We define a “pseudocode” that should be
familiar to you if you have done computer programming, and we use it to show
how we shall specify our algorithms. Having specified the insertion sort
algorithm, we then argue that it correctly sorts, and we analyze its running
time. The analysis introduces a notation that focuses on how that time
increases with the number of items to be sorted. Following our discussion of
insertion sort, we introduce the divide-and-conquer approach to the design of
algorithms and use it to develop an algorithm called merge sort. We end with an
analysis of merge sort’s running time.
