This part will start you thinking about designing and analyzing algorithms. It
is intended to be a gentle introduction to how we specify algorithms, some of
the design strategies we will use throughout this book, and many of the
fundamental ideas used in algorithm analysis. Later parts of this book will
build upon this base.
